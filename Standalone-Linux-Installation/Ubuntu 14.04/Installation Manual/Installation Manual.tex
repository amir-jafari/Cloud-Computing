\section{NVIDIA AND CUDA 7.5 INSTALLATION - Non UEFI}

\textbf{Installing CUDA Toolkit 7.5 on Ubuntu 14.04 Linux}

The following explains how to install CUDA Toolkit 7.5 on 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 Linux. I have tested it on a self-assembled desktop with NVIDIA GeForce GTX Black Titan graphics card. The instruction assumes you have the necessary CUDA compatible hardware support. Depending on your system configuration, your mileage may vary \cite{NVIDIADRIVER}.

\textbf{CUDA Repository Download}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Retrieve the CUDA repository package for Ubuntu 14.04 from the provided file.
  \item Put run file in the following directory (\textbackslash home \textbackslash Downloads)
   \item Search for terminal, put on to task bar, and open it (then do the following commands).
\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ cd \Downloads

    $ ls
\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
    \item You should be able to see cuda\_7.5.18\_linux.run
\suspend{enumerate}

\textbf{CUDA Toolkit and Display Driver Installation}

\resume{enumerate}
    \item Then you have to kill the xserver by entering the following command into terminal.
\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ sudo service lightdm stop
\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
    \item The gui will switch off and you will see the black screen.
    \item Hold the Ctrl+Alt+F1 key.
    \item Type in username and hit enter.
    \item Type in password (you will not see what you type in.)
    \item Enter the following commands.
    \item \textbf{Note: Any time you copy and paste underscore go back and replace it with new underscore in terminal.}
\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ cd \Downloads

    $ ls

    $ chmod +x cuda_7.5.18_linux.run
\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
    \item Start the installation by the following command.
    \item \textbf{Note: Any time you copy and paste underscore go back and replace it with new underscore in terminal.}
\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $./cuda_7.5.18_linux.run
\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
\item Press q key to skip the read me file.
\item accept EULA ------ accept.
\item when terminal prompts for yes or no always yes.
\item when terminal asks for location hit enter (this is the default location)
\item after the the installation finished, we need to reboot. Do the following commands to reboot.
\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ sudo su

    # reboot
\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
\item Redo the steps from 9 to 24 again for the full installation \textbf{except} for the following command.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ chmod +x cuda_7.5.18_linux.run
\end{lstlisting}

Now, after the system is rebooted you can search the additional driver in the Linux search box (first item in the taskbar) and you should be able to see the manually install driver checked. Also you can see check this command to be sure the GPU is installed correctly.

This following command checks to see if the installation worked properly.

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ nvidia-smi
\end{lstlisting}

\section{NVIDIA AND CUDA 7.5 INSTALLATION - UEFI}

The following explains how to install CUDA Toolkit on 64-bit Ubuntu 14.04 Linux. I have tested it on a self-assembled desktop with NVIDIA Quadroo P5000 graphics card. The instruction assumes you have the necessary CUDA compatible hardware support. Depending on your system configuration, your mileage may vary \cite{NVIDIADRIVER}.

\textbf{Display Driver Installation Download}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item One might have installed the driver via apt-get. So before reinstall the driver from runfile, uninstalling previous installations is required. 
  \item Executing the following scripts carefully one by one.
\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ sudo apt-get purge nvidia*
\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
    \item The latest NVIDIA driver for Linux OS can be fetched from NVIDIA's official website. The first one in the list, i.e. Latest Long Lived Branch version for Linux x86\_64/AMD64/EM64T, is suitable for most case.
\suspend{enumerate}

\textbf{CUDA Toolkit and Display Driver Installation}

\resume{enumerate}
    \item For Ubuntu, installing the following dependencies is enough.
\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib dkms
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Creat Blacklist for Nouveau Driver}

\resume{enumerate}
    \item Create a file at /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf with the following contents
    \item blacklist nouveau
    \item options nouveau modeset=0

\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf

    blacklist nouveau
    options nouveau modeset=0
\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
    \item Close the by Ctrl + x
    \item yes
\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ sudo update-initramfs -u
    
    $ sudo reboot
\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
\item After the computer is rebooted. We need to stop the desktop manager before excuting the runfile to install the driver. lightdm is the default desktop manager in Ubuntu. 
\item  For Ubuntu 14.04 / 16.04, excuting sudo service lightdm stop (or use gdm or kdm instead of lightdm)

\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ cd ~
    
    $ chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-384.69.run
    
    $ sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-384.69.run 

\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
\item accept EULA ------ accept.
\item when terminal prompts for yes or no always yes.
\item when terminal asks for location hit enter (this is the default location)
\item after the the installation finished, we need to reboot. Do the following commands to reboot.

    $ sudo service lightdm stop
\end{lstlisting}

Install the cuda driver by downloading it from the NVIDIA cuda toolkit website. Run the debain file \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads}{here}. Follow how the installation commands. After your run the cuda then you get some seris of questions for signing the driver. Answer yes to sign the driver and set the password. When the installtion finshed use mok and then provide the same password. by this time you have cuda toolkit and driver installed.

\section{TORCH INSTALLATION GUIDE}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Torch can be installed to your home folder in {\tiny $\sim$}/torch by running these three commands \cite{TORCH}:
    \item Open terminal and enter the following commands.
    \item \textbf{Note: Any time you see yes or no in the installation type yes}.
\suspend{enumerate}

    $ cd ~/torch; bash install-deps;

    $ cd ~/torch

    $ ./install.sh
\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
    \item The first script installs the basic package dependencies that LuaJIT and Torch require. The second script installs LuaJIT, LuaRocks, and then uses LuaRocks (the lua package manager) to install core packages like torch, nn and paths, as well as a few other packages.

    \item The script adds torch to your PATH variable. You just have to source it once to refresh your env variables. The installation script will detect what is your current shell and modify the path in the correct configuration file.
    \item Enter the following command.
\suspend{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}
    $ cd ..

    $ source ~/.bashrc
\end{lstlisting}

\resume{enumerate}
    \item New packages can be installed using Luarocks from the command-line:
\end{enumerate}
